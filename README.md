## For Users


## For Developers

### Vocabulary

Events are "attended" by one "coordinator" and any number of "participants". Thus an event is "participatable" if it can have participants, but may not be "joinable", which means accepting of new participants or a new coordinator.

### Tests

Test by running 'rspec'.
