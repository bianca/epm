It is old and the branches break easily. As well, please avoid walking in the dirt garden completely. It is new, soft soil that we don't want compressed from the weight of bodies walking on it. Note that the apricots closer to ground level still need more time to ripen. They are still partly green where they attach to the tree (hard to see) and won't ripen to their full potential if picked too early (too hard and too sour). The apricots closer to the top are ready to go! Also, please make sure there is a thorough cleanup when you're done. Any leftover fruit on the ground brings pests that can cause disease to our tree, along with flies and wasps and rotting fruit stink. Any damage caused to wires or the physical house will be the responsibility of your organization to fix. I think what you guys are doing is wonderful, but it does worry me since the tree is so big, delicate and close to the house/wires. Please be careful! Thank you!",,,,,,,,2014,2015,,,,,,,,

1527,Tree too tall - unpickable,"2015 - 16 lbs apples picked Aug 13. Pretty good quality, underripe. The tree was about 3 stories high with all the fruit bearing limbs pruned to the 2nd story; so even with picker poles could barely reach the lowest fruit. The homeowners provided two ladders and were very accommodating to our requests to climb on things and move the furniture around in the small, cluttered, backyard. We could still not reach the majority of the fruit. Another hazard in the backyard was the criss-crossing telephone wires and clothes lines that hampered our ability to climb and pick in certain areas. An extra ladder, an A shape ladder and resourcefulness is needed to glean this tree. Finally, the apples that we were able to pick from both trees were quite small (diameter 5-8cm).
