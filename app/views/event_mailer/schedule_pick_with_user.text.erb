Hi <%= @tree.owner.fname %>, 
 
We'd like to schedule <%= Configurable.event.indefinitize %> in the next couple of weeks at your property for the <%=@tree.species %> tree you registered with us.

<%=root_url %>events/schedule?tree_id=<%=@tree.id %>
 
Thank you so much for offering to share the bounty of your tree this summer!
