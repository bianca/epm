Hi <%= @user.fname %>, 

Thank you so much for offering to share the bounty of your tree this summer!
 
This year we are scheduling picks through Not Far From the Tree’s online picking portal to let our lead volunteers claim picks faster. As a tree registrant, you now have access to your tree profile where you can update your tree information and provide us with dates and times you would prefer we schedule a fruit pick.
 
You can log into the portal at any time. First, click the link below to provide this email, then recieve instructions to set your new password.

If you aren’t interested in us picking your tree this year or have no fruit this season, please let us know here. 
 
Fruitfully Yours, 
Not Far From The Tree
